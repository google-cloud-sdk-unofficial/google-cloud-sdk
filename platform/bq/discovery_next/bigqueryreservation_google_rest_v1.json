NOTE: capping a reservation's idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value.

This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. However, the autoscale field may still be in the output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots.

Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don't allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and slot_capacity>=max_slots, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/help\/conditions\/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/).",

Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination, and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching type. Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example: * The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`. * Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. \"None\" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a \"None\" assignment, use \"none\" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects\/myproject\/locations\/US\/reservations\/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation.
