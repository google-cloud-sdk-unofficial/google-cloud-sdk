"""API for accessing data files from the Google codebase.

Provide a consistent API for accessing data files from the Google
codebase, whether the program is being run from a PAR file, a
Google3 module-space, or whatever.

A "resource" is simply the contents of a named file, and can be made available
by adding a data dependency in the BUILD file, e.g.:

    data = ["//foo/bar:filename.txt"],

The name of a resource is something like
`google3/tools/includes/IMPORTMAP`.  Formally, it's a relative path
name, and it's relative to the root of the Google code base (the
directory immediately above the google, google2, google3
directories).

Path components are separated by forward slashes on all platforms
regardless of the native filesystem conventions.

Search order for resources:
 1) If this module was loaded from a parfile, look in the parfile.
 2) Look relative to this module's `__file__` attribute, outside of READONLY
    to give files that are opened in the P4 client preference.
 3) Look relative to this module's `__file__` attribute, if available
 4) Look relative to `sitecustomize.GOOGLEBASE`, if available
 5) Look relative to `os.environ["GOOGLEBASE"]`, if available
 6) Check for a READONLY symlink for srcfs

Unless otherwise noted, these functions are NOT thread-safe.

  """Provide a pathlib-style access to files inside the google3 runfiles directory.

  This is a read-only view of data dependencies of your build rule. It is
  preferred over GetResource() or GetResourceFilename(). The functionality
  is thread-safe, and it does not trigger a .par file extraction to disk.

  Unlike other methods here, there is no filesystem resolution order: only
  one location: Either runfiles or the par file, will be observed.

  The return value of a Get('filename') call is an object that implements
  the methods of go/importlib.abc.Traversable.

  The important methods are:

    * resources.Get(path).open() -> IO[str]
    * resources.Get(path).open(mode='rb') -> IO[bytes]
    * resources.Get(path).read_bytes() -> bytes
    * resources.Get(path).read_text() -> str
    * resources.Get(path).joinpath(name) -> Traversable

  In a .par file context, the concrete class of the Traversable will be
  zipfile.Path, and in a runfiles context (such as a Python unit test) it will
  be pathlib.Path.

  Example usage:

      from pyglib import resources

      with resources.Get('google3/project/testdata/input.txt').open() as f:
        for line in f:
          process(line)

      testdata_dir = resources.Get('google3/project/testdata')
      inputs = [testdata_dir.joinpath(filename).read_text()
                for filename in filenames]

  Supported on Python 3.10 or later.

  Args:
    *paths: The path segements to join together to find the file under the
      runfiles directory. For example: ('google3/pyglib/build_data.txt') or
      ('google3/pyglib/testdata', 'gfile_test.txt')

  Returns:
    An go/importlib.abc.Traversable instance, which gives important methods
    like: is_dir(), is_file(), joinpath(child), open(mode=...), read_bytes()
    and read_text(). If the path does not exist, then no error will be raised.
