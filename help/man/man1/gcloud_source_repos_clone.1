.SH "EXAMPLES"

To use the default Google Cloud repository for development, use the following
commands. We recommend that you use your project name as TARGET_DIR to make it
apparent which directory is used for which project. We also recommend to clone
the repository named 'default' since it is automatically created for each
project, and its contents can be browsed and edited in the Developers Console.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud init
$ gcloud source repos clone default TARGET_DIR
$ cd TARGET_DIR
... create/edit files and create one or more commits ...
$ git push origin master
