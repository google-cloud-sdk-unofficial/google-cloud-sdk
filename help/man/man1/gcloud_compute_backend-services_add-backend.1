.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute backend\-services add\-backend\fR is used to add a backend to
a backend service. A backend is a group of tasks that can handle requests sent
to a backend service. Currently, the group of tasks can be one or more Google
Compute Engine virtual machine instances grouped together using an instance
group.

Traffic is first spread evenly across all virtual machines in the group. When
the group is full, traffic is sent to the next nearest group(s) that still have
remaining capacity.

To modify the parameters of a backend after it has been added to the backend
service, use 'gcloud compute backend\-services update\-backend' or 'gcloud
compute backend\-services edit'.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the backend service.


.RE

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

\fB\-\-instance\-group\fR \fIINSTANCE_GROUP\fR
.RS 2m
The name or URI of a Google Cloud Instance Group.


.RE

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

\fB\-\-balancing\-mode\fR \fIBALANCING_MODE\fR
.RS 2m
Defines the strategy for balancing load. \f5\fIUTILIZATION\fR\fR will rely on
the CPU utilization of the instances in the group when balancing load. When
using \f5\fIUTILIZATION\fR\fR, \f5\fI\-\-max\-utilization\fR\fR can be used to
set a maximum target CPU utilization for each instance. \f5\fIRATE\fR\fR will
spread load based on how many requests per second (RPS) the group can handle.
There are two ways to specify max RPS: \f5\fI\-\-max\-rate\fR\fR which defines
the max RPS for the whole group or \f5\fI\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR\fR,
which defines the max RPS on a per\-instance basis.

In \f5\fIUTILIZATION\fR\fR, you can optionally limit based on RPS in addition to
CPU by setting either \f5\fI\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR\fR or
\f5\fI\-\-max\-rate\fR\fR.

.RE
\fB\-\-capacity\-scaler\fR \fICAPACITY_SCALER\fR
.RS 2m
A float in the range [0, 1.0] that scales the maximum parameters for the group
(e.g., max rate). A value of 0.0 will cause no requests to be sent to the group
(i.e., it adds the group in a \f5\fIdrained\fR\fR state). The default is 1.0.

.RE
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 2m
An optional, textual description for the backend.

.RE
\fB\-\-instance\-group\-zone\fR \fIINSTANCE_GROUP_ZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instance group to add to the backend service. If not specified,
you will be prompted to select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.

.RE
\fB\-\-max\-rate\fR \fIMAX_RATE\fR
.RS 2m
Maximum requests per second (RPS) that the group can handle.

.RE
\fB\-\-max\-rate\-per\-instance\fR \fIMAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE\fR
.RS 2m
The maximum per\-instance requests per second (RPS).

.RE
\fB\-\-max\-utilization\fR \fIMAX_UTILIZATION\fR
.RS 2m
The target CPU utilization for the group as a float in the range [0.0, 1.0].
This flag can only be provided when the balancing mode is
\f5\fIUTILIZATION\fR\fR.

.RE
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instance group to add to the backend service. DEPRECATED, use
\-\-instance\-group\-zone flag instead.


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"
