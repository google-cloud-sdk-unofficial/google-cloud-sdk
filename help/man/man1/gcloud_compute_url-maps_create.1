.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute url\-maps create\fR is used to create URL maps which map HTTP
and HTTPS request URLs to backend services. Mappings are done using a
longest\-match strategy.

There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher. A host
rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher. A path matcher maps request paths
to backend services. For example, a host rule can map the hosts
\f5\fI\fB.google.com\fR\fR and \f5\fIgoogle.com\fR\fR to a path matcher called
\f5\fIwww\fR\fR. The \f5\fIwww\fR\fR path matcher in turn can map the path
\f5\fI/search/\fR\fR\fR to the search backend service and everything else to a
default backend service.

Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map is
created by using 'gcloud compute url\-maps edit' or by using 'gcloud compute
url\-maps add\-path\-matcher' and 'gcloud compute url\-maps add\-host\-rule'.
