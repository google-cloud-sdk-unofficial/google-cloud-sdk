.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute url\-maps add\-host\-rule\fR is used to add a mapping of hosts
to a patch matcher in a URL map. The mapping will match the host component of
HTTP requests to path matchers which in turn map the request to a backend
service. Before adding a host rule, at least one path matcher must exist in the
URL map to take care of the path component of the requests. 'gcloud compute
url\-maps add\-path\-matcher' or 'gcloud compute url\-maps edit' can be used to
add path matchers.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the URL map.


.RE

.SH "REQUIRED FLAGS"

\fB\-\-hosts\fR \fIHOST\fR,[\fIHOST\fR,...]
.RS 2m
The set of hosts to match requests against. Each host must be a fully qualified
domain name (FQDN) with the exception that the host can begin with a ``*'' or
``*\-''. ``*'' acts as a glob and will match any string of atoms to the left
where an atom is separated by dots (``.'') or dashes (``\-'').

.RE
\fB\-\-path\-matcher\-name\fR \fIPATH_MATCHER_NAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the patch matcher to use if a request matches this host rule. The
patch matcher must already exist in the URL map (see 'gcloud compute url\-maps
add\-path\-matcher').


.RE

.SH "OPTIONAL FLAGS"

\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 2m
An optional, textual description for the host rule.


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands.



.SH "EXAMPLES"

To create a host rule mapping the \f5*\-foo.google.com\fR and \f5google.com\fR
hosts to the \f5www\fR path matcher, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute url\-maps add\-host\-rule MY\-URL\-MAP \e
    \-\-hosts '*\-foo.google.com,google.com' \-\-path\-matcher\-name www
