.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Upgrades the Kubernetes version of an existing container cluster.

This command upgrades the Kubernetes version of the \fBnodes\fR of a cluster.
The Kubernetes version of the cluster's \fBmaster\fR is periodically upgraded
automatically as new releases are available.

\fBBy running this command, all of the cluster's nodes will be deleted and\fR
\fBrecreated one at a time.\fR While persistent Kubernetes resources, such as
pods backed by replication controllers, will be rescheduled onto new nodes, a
small cluster may experience a few minutes where there are insufficient nodes
available to run all of the scheduled Kubernetes resources.

\fBPlease ensure that any data you wish to keep is stored on a persistent\fR
\fBdisk before upgrading the cluster.\fR Ephemeral Kubernetes resources\-\-in
particular, pods without replication controllers\-\-will be lost, while
persistent Kubernetes resources will get rescheduled.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the cluster to upgrade.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-async\fR
.RS 2m
Don't wait for the operation to complete. Use \fB\-\-no\-async\fR to disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-cluster\-version\fR \fICLUSTER_VERSION\fR
.RS 2m
The Kubernetes release version to which to upgrade the cluster's nodes. Omit to
upgrade the nodes to the version the cluster's Kubernetes master is running.

If provided, the \-\-cluster\-version must be no greater than the cluster
master's minor version (x.\fBX\fR.x), and must be a latest patch version
(x.x.\fBX\fR).

You can find the current master version by running

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> | grep MasterVersion
.RE

You can find the list of allowed node versions for upgrades by running

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container get\-server\-config
.RE

and looking at the returned "validNodeVersions".

.RE
\fB\-\-master\fR
.RS 2m
Upgrade the cluster's master to the latest version of Kubernetes supported on
Container Engine. Nodes cannot be upgraded at the same time as the master.

.RE
\fB\-\-node\-pool\fR \fINODE_POOL\fR
.RS 2m
The node pool to upgrade.

.RE
\fB\-\-wait\fR
.RS 2m
Poll the operation for completion after issuing a create request. Use
\fB\-\-no\-wait\fR to disable.

.RE
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR, \fB\-z\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The compute zone (e.g. us\-central1\-a) for the cluster


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands.



.SH "EXAMPLES"

Upgrade the nodes of <cluster> to the Kubernetes version of the cluster's
master.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster>
.RE

Upgrade the nodes of <cluster> to Kubernetes version x.y.z.

.RS 2m
$ gcloud container clusters upgrade <cluster> \e
    \-\-cluster\-version "x.y.z"
