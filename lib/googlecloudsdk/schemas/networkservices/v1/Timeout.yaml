  connectTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for a single origin connection to be
      established, including DNS lookup, TLS handshake, and TCP/QUIC connection
      establishment. Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between
      1s and 15s. The `connect_timeout` capped by the deadline set by the
      request's max_attempts_timeout. The last connection attempt may have a
      smaller `connect_timeout` in order to adhere to the overall
      `max_attempts_timeout`.
    type: string
  maxAttemptsTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum time across all connection attempts to all origins, including
      failover origins, before returning an error to the client. A HTTP 504 is
      returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned. Defaults
      to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s. If a
      failover_origin is specified, the `max_attempts_timeout` of the first
      configured origin sets the deadline for all connection attempts across all
      failover_origins.
    type: string
  readTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait between reads of a single HTTP
      connection/stream. Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value
      between 1s and 30s. The `read_timeout` is capped by the response_timeout.
      All reads of the HTTP connection/stream must be completed by the deadline
      set by the response_timeout. If the response headers have already been
      written to the connection, the response is truncated and logged.
    type: string
  responseTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for the last byte of a response to arrive
      when reading from the HTTP connection/stream. Defaults to 30 seconds. The
      timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s. The `response_timeout` starts
      after the connection has been established. Origins that take longer to
      write additional bytes to the response than the configured
      `response_timeout` result in an error returned to the client. If the
      response headers have already been written to the connection, the response
      is truncated and logged.
