  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy should behave if the call to the extension fails
      or times out. When set to TRUE, request/response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the ExtensionChain will also
      execute. When set to FALSE: * If Response Headers have not been delivered
      to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the client.
      The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error response
      in the Load Balancer, the error response. * If Response Headers have been
      delivered, then the HTTP stream to the downstream client will be reset.
      Default is False.
