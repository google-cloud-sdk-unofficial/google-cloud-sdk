  AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
  specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the
  exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with
  multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service": "allServices",

  sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ
  logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and
  `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

  Fields:
    auditLogConfigs: The configuration for logging of each type of permission.
    service: Specifies a service that will be enabled for audit logging. For

      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding

      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A

      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from
      external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. *
      `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
      account. For example, `alice@example.com` . *

      An identifier for a [Kubernetes service

      example, `admins@example.com`. *
      `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
      identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For
      example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is
      recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user
      retains the role in the binding. *
      `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address

  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of

  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a

  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To

    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
