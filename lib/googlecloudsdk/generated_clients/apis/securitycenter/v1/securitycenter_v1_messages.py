  r"""Represents an access event.

  Fields:
    callerIp: Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
    callerIpGeo: The caller IP's geolocation, which identifies where the call
      came from.
    methodName: The method that the service account called, e.g.
      "SetIamPolicy".
    principalEmail: Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email
      address of the authenticated user (or service account on behalf of third
      party principal) making the request. For third party identity callers,
      the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this field. For
      privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes redacted. For
      more information, see [Caller identities in audit
      logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
    principalSubject: A string representing the principal_subject associated
      with the identity. As compared to `principal_email`, supports principals
      that aren't associated with email addresses, such as third party
      principals. For most identities, the format will be
      `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool name}/subjects/{subject}`
      except for some GKE identities (GKE_WORKLOAD, FREEFORM,
      GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD) that are still in the legacy format
      `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`
    serviceAccountDelegationInfo: Identity delegation history of an
      authenticated service account that makes the request. It contains
      information on the real authorities that try to access GCP resources by
      delegating on a service account. When multiple authorities are present,
      they are guaranteed to be sorted based on the original ordering of the
      identity delegation events.
    serviceAccountKeyName: The name of the service account key used to create
      or exchange credentials for authenticating the service account making
      the request. This is a scheme-less URI full resource name. For example:
      "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/ke
      ys/{key}"
    serviceName: This is the API service that the service account made a call
      to, e.g. "iam.googleapis.com"
    userAgentFamily: What kind of user agent is associated, e.g. operating
      system shells, embedded or stand-alone applications, etc.
    userName: A string representing a username. This is likely not an IAM
      principal. For instance, this may be the system user name if the finding
      is VM-related, or this may be some type of application login user name,
      depending on the type of finding.

        by an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
        to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
        additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
        Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data, public SSH
        access with weak or no passwords, etc. Threat: Indicates a threat that
        is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
        within existing resources.
      HIGH: Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
        and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to
        gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
        exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges
        to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak
        or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database
        could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the
        internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create
        new computational resources in an environment but not able to access
        data or execute code in existing resources.
      MEDIUM: Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
        actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to
        eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access
        and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An
        example is a service account with access to more projects than it
        should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they
        could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service
        account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able
        to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute
        unauthorized code.
      LOW: Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
        organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in
        their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security
        issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource
        configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has

      based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",

  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

      period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is

      will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult fields to be
      listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The
      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those
      defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name *
      security_center_properties.resource_name *
      resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: *
      name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time =

      security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example,

      `resource_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on
      the empty string to filter based on a property not existing:
      `-resource_properties.my_property : ""`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,resource_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and
      " name desc , resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The

    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. The filter

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had
      its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the
      finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of
      time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
      compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based
      on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made
      inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding
      was present and matched the given filter at the start of
      compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED":
      indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at
      the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. *
      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the
      response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *
      resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:`

      resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.display_name: `=`,
      `:`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and "
      name desc , source_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The following
      fields are supported: name parent state category resource_name
      event_time source_properties security_marks.marks

  r"""A SecuritycenterOrganizationsAssetsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetsResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was
      added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period
      of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time
      - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived
      based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed
      and re-created again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "ADDED": indicates that the asset was
      not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at read_time.
      * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the start of
      compare_duration, but not present at read_time. * "ACTIVE": indicates
      that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time
      period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is
      not specified, then the only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which
      will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult fields to be
      listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The
      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those
      defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name *
      security_center_properties.resource_name *
      resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: *
      name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `update_time = 1560208038000` *
      create_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `create_time = 1560208038000` *
      iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` *

      security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example,
      `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial
      match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing:
      `resource_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on
      the empty string to filter based on a property not existing:
      `-resource_properties.my_property : ""`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,resource_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and
      " name desc , resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The
      following fields are supported: name update_time resource_properties
      security_marks.marks security_center_properties.resource_name
      security_center_properties.resource_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_parent

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's

      its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the
      finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of
      time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
      compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based
      on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made
      inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding
      was present and matched the given filter at the start of
      compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED":
      indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at

      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the
      response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *
      resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:`

      resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.display_name: `=`,
      `:`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and "
      name desc , source_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The following
      fields are supported: name parent state category resource_name
      event_time source_properties security_marks.marks

      Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
    pageToken: The value returned by the last `ListFindingsResponse`;
      indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFindings` call,

      or projects/{projects_id}/sources/-
    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering findings. The
      filter is limited to findings existing at the supplied time and their

      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: *
      name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `update_time = 1560208038000` *
      create_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `create_time = 1560208038000` *
      iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` *

      security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example,
      `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial
      match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing:
      `resource_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on
      the empty string to filter based on a property not existing:
      `-resource_properties.my_property : ""`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,resource_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and
      " name desc , resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The
      following fields are supported: name update_time resource_properties
      security_marks.marks security_center_properties.resource_name
      security_center_properties.resource_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_parent

      the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. *
      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the
      response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *
      resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:`
      * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.type: `=`, `:` *
      resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.display_name: `=`,
      `:`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and "
      name desc , source_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The following
      fields are supported: name parent state category resource_name
      event_time source_properties security_marks.marks
    pageSize: The maximum number of results to return in a single response.
      Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
    pageToken: The value returned by the last `ListFindingsResponse`;
      indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFindings` call,
      and that the system should return the next page of data.
    parent: Required. Name of the source the findings belong to. Its format is
      "organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id],
      folders/[folder_id]/sources/[source_id], or
      projects/[project_id]/sources/[source_id]". To list across all sources
      provide a source_id of `-`. For example:
      organizations/{organization_id}/sources/-, folders/{folder_id}/sources/-
      or projects/{projects_id}/sources/-
    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering findings. The
      filter is limited to findings existing at the supplied time and their
      values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will
      default to the API's version of NOW.
