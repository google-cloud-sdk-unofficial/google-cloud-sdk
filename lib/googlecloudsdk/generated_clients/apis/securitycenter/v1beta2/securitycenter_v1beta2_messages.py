class Access(_messages.Message):
  r"""Represents an access event.

  Fields:
    callerIp: Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
    callerIpGeo: The caller IP's geolocation, which identifies where the call
      came from.
    methodName: The method that the service account called, e.g.
      "SetIamPolicy".
    principalEmail: Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email
      address of the authenticated user (or service account on behalf of third
      party principal) making the request. For third party identity callers,
      the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this field. For
      privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes redacted. For
      more information, see [Caller identities in audit
      logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
    principalSubject: A string representing the principal_subject associated
      with the identity. As compared to `principal_email`, supports principals
      that aren't associated with email addresses, such as third party
      principals. For most identities, the format will be
      `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool name}/subjects/{subject}`
      except for some GKE identities (GKE_WORKLOAD, FREEFORM,
      GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD) that are still in the legacy format
      `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`
    serviceAccountDelegationInfo: Identity delegation history of an
      authenticated service account that makes the request. It contains
      information on the real authorities that try to access GCP resources by
      delegating on a service account. When multiple authorities are present,
      they are guaranteed to be sorted based on the original ordering of the
      identity delegation events.
    serviceAccountKeyName: The name of the service account key used to create
      or exchange credentials for authenticating the service account making
      the request. This is a scheme-less URI full resource name. For example:
      "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/ke
      ys/{key}"
    serviceName: This is the API service that the service account made a call
      to, e.g. "iam.googleapis.com"
    userAgentFamily: What kind of user agent is associated, e.g. operating
      system shells, embedded or stand-alone applications, etc.
    username: A string representing a username. This is likely not an IAM
      principal. For instance, this may be the system user name if the finding
      is VM-related, or this may be some type of application login user name,
      depending on the type of finding.

    Values:

        doesn't write a severity value.
      CRITICAL: Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable
        by an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
        to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
        additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
        Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data, public SSH
        access with weak or no passwords, etc. Threat: Indicates a threat that
        is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
        within existing resources.
      HIGH: Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
        and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to
        gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
        exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges
        to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak
        or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database
        could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the
        internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create
        new computational resources in an environment but not able to access
        data or execute code in existing resources.
      MEDIUM: Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
        actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to
        eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access
        and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An
        example is a service account with access to more projects than it
        should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they
        could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service
        account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able
        to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute
        unauthorized code.
      LOW: Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
        organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in
        their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security
        issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource
        configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has
        obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able to access
        data, execute code, or create resources.
