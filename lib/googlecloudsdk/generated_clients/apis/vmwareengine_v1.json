A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`. For example, if you are filtering a list of network peerings, you can exclude the ones named `example-network` by specifying `name != \"example-network\"`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = \"example-network\") (createTime > \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (name = \"example-network-1\") AND (createTime > \"2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z\") OR (name = \"example-network-2\") ```",
