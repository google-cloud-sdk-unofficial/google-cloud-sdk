  help_text: |
    CIDR Range for the TPU.

    The IP range that the TPU will select an IP address from.
    Must be in CIDR notation and a `/29` range, for example
    `192.168.0.0/29`. Errors will occur if the CIDR range has already been
    used for a currently existing TPU, the CIDR range conflicts with any
    networks in the user's provided network, or the provided network is
    peered with another network that is using that CIDR range.

preemptible:
  api_field: node.schedulingConfig.preemptible
  arg_name: preemptible
  type: bool
  default: false
  required: false
  help_text: |
    If provided, the TPU will be preemptible and time-limited. It may be
    preempted to free up resources for standard TPUs, and will only be able
    to run for a limited amount of time.

    Spot VMs may be preempted at any time if the capacity is needed, but unless preempted there is
    no limit on runtime duration. Spot VM TPUs cannot be restarted, and must be recreated again.

  api_field: node.schedulingConfig.reserved
  arg_name: reserved
  type: bool
  default: false
  required: false
  help_text: |
    When specified, will attempt to create the TPU node under reservations made in the current
    project. The reservations can be made separately but used in aggregated form. i.e., the user can
    make a reservation of 128 V2 TPUs and later on make another reservation of 128 V2 TPUs then
    creates a v2-256 TPU instance. If there exists no reservation or not sufficient amount of
    reserved cores under the project, the request will fail due to lack of capacity.

service_account:
  api_field: node.serviceAccount.email
  arg_name: service-account

clear_labels:
  arg_name: clear-labels
  type: bool
  default: false
