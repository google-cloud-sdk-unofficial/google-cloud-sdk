node_id:
  arg_name: node-id
  required: true
  help_text: |
    Unqualified node identifier used to identify the node in the project once provisioned.

    To request a resource with multiple nodes, use `--node-prefix` to specify the prefix for each node
    and `--node-count` to specify the number of nodes in place of `--node-id`.

node_prefix:
  arg_name: node-prefix
  required: true
  help_text: |
    Node prefix used to generate the qualified name of each node the multislice node provision.

    Must also specify `--node-count`.

node_count:
  arg_name: node-count
  required: true
  type: int
  help_text: |
    The number of nodes in a multislice provision, also used to generate the qualified name for
    nodes in the provision. Value must be greater than 1.

    Must also specify `--node-prefix`.

accelerator_type:
  arg_name: accelerator-type
  required: true
  type: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.util.hooks.types:LowerCaseType
  help_text: |
    Accelerator type for the TPU.

runtime_version:
  arg_name: runtime-version
  required: true
  help_text: |
    Runtime version for the TPU, such as `2.3`.

best_effort:
  arg_name: best-effort
  type: bool
  action: store_true
  help_text: |
    If provided, the Node requested here may be scheduled at the 'best effort' tier.

guaranteed:
  arg_name: guaranteed
  type: bool
  action: store_true
  help_text: |
    If provided, the Node requested here will only be scheduled at the 'guaranteed' tier.

min_duration:
  arg_name: min-duration
  api_field: queuedResource.guaranteed.minDuration
  help_text: |
    The minimum period of time the Node is needed. If specified, the requested Node will only
    be scheduled if there is sufficient capacity for the given duration.

    If this flag is set the guaranteed flag is also set.

reserved:
  arg_name: reserved
  type: bool
  action: store_true
  default: null
  api_field: queuedResource.guaranteed.reserved
  help_text: |
    Specifies the request should be scheduled on reserved capacity.

    If this flag is set the guaranteed flag is also set.

valid_after_duration:
  arg_name: valid-after-duration
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDuration
  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDurationForJson
  api_field: queuedResource.queueingPolicy.validAfterDuration
  help_text: |
    A duration before which the TPU must not be provisioned, relative to the current time.
    See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

valid_after_time:
  arg_name: valid-after-time
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDateTime
  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDateTime
  api_field: queuedResource.queueingPolicy.validAfterTime
  help_text: |
    An absolute time before which the TPU must not be provisioned.
    See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDurationForJson
  api_field: queuedResource.queueingPolicy.validUntilDuration
  help_text: |
    A duration after which the TPU must not be provisioned, relative to the current time.
    See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

valid_until_time:
  arg_name: valid-until-time
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:ParseDateTime
  processor: googlecloudsdk.core.util.times:FormatDateTime
  api_field: queuedResource.queueingPolicy.validUntilTime
  help_text: |
    An absolute time after which resources must not be created.
    See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.

    addresses will be associated with the TPU workers.
