            Action to be performed on the Rollout.
            The default behavior is to run the rollout until it naturally reaches a
            terminal state.
          choices:

            help_text: |-
              Run the Rollout until it naturally reaches a terminal state.
              A rollout requested to run will progress through all natural Rollout
              States (such as RUNNING -> SUCCEEDED or RUNNING -> FAILED).
              If retriable errors are encountered during the rollout, the rollout
              will paused by default and can be resumed by re-requesting this RUN
              action.
