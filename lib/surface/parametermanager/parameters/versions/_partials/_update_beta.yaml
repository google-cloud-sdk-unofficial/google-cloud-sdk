    brief: Updates the properties of a single Parameter Manager parameter version
    description: |
      Updates the properties of a single parameter version, including status of the parameter version
      (enabled/disabled).
    examples: |-
      To update a parameter version `my-parameter-version` of parameter `my-parameter` in location `global` run:

      $ {command} my-parameter-version --parameter=my-parameter --location=global
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        Identifier. [Output only] The resource name of the ParameterVersion in the format
        `projects/*/locations/*/parameters/*/versions/*`.
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.parametermanager.v1_resources:projects_locations_parameters_versions
      required: true
    - arg_name: disabled
      api_field: parameterVersion.disabled
      action: store_true_false
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        Disabled boolean to determine if a ParameterVersion acts as a metadata only
        resource (payload is never returned if disabled is true). If true any calls
        will always default to BASIC view even if the user explicitly passes FULL
        view as part of the request. A render call on a disabled resource fails
        with an error. Default value is False.
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
        request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
