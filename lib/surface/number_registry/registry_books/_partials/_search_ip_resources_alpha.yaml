    brief: Search IP resources in a registry book
    description: |
      Search IP resources in a registry book using IP address, IP version, attributes, etc.
    examples: |-
      To search for an ip address across ranges in a registry book run:

      $ {command} my-registry-book --location=global --query="ip_address=10.0.0.1 AND ip_version=IPV4"

      To search for a range in a registry book with text in its attributes run:

      $ {command} my-registry-book --location=global --query="attribute_text=foo"

      To search for a range in a registry book with exact text in its attributes run:

      $ {command} my-registry-book --location=global --query="attribute:(foo=bar)"

      To additionally show the utilization of a range in a registry book run:

      $ {command} my-registry-book --location=global --query="ip_address=10.0.0.1 AND ip_version=IPV4" --show-utilization
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The name of the RegistryBook to search in.
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.number_registry.v1alpha_resources:projects_locations_registry_books
      required: true
    - arg_name: query
      api_field: searchIpResourcesRequest.query
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        Search query. This string filters resources in an AIP-160-like format.
        It has some limitations. You can only specify top level conjunctions or
        attribute level negations. Each restriction can only be used once except
        the attribute restriction. The available restrictions are:
        - `realm`: The realm name to search in.
        - `ip_address`: The IP address to search for within ranges.
        - `ip_version`: The IP version to filter by (e.g., "IPV4", "IPV6").
        - `attribute_text`: The attribute text to search for within ranges.
        - `attribute`: The attribute key and value to filter by.

        Only one of attribute_text or multiple attribute filters can be specified.
        Examples:
        - realm=test-realm
        - realm=test-realm AND ip_address=10.0.0.0
        - realm=test-realm AND ip_version=IPV6
        - realm=test-realm AND attribute_text=test
        - realm=test-realm AND attribute_text=test AND ip_version=IPV4
        - ip_address=10.0.0.0 AND NOT attribute:(key1=value1)
    - arg_name: show-utilization
      api_field: searchIpResourcesRequest.showUtilization
      action: store_true
      required: false
      type: bool
