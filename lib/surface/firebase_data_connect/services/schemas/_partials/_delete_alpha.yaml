    brief: Deletes Firebase Data Connect service schema.
    description: |
      Deletes Firebase Data Connect service schema.
    examples: |-
      Deletes schema with given id.

      $ {command} main --location=my-location --project=my-project --service=my-service
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The name of the schema to delete, in the format projects/{project}/locations/{location}/services/{service}/schemas/{schema}.
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.firebase_data_connect.v1alpha_resources:project_location_service_schema
      required: true
    - arg_name: force
      api_field: force
      action: store_true
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If set to true, any child resources (i.e. SchemaRevisions) will also be
        deleted.
      default: null
    - arg_name: etag
      api_field: etag
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        The etag of the Schema. If this is provided, it must match
        the server's etag.
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
        request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
    - arg_name: allow-missing
      api_field: allowMissing
      action: store_true
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If true and the Schema is not found, the request will
        succeed but no action will be taken on the server.
      default: null
    - arg_name: validate-only
      api_field: validateOnly
      action: store_true
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If set, validate the request and preview the Schema, but do not actually
        delete it.
