        The name of the framework deployment that you want to delete,
        in the format
        `organizations/{organization}/locations/{location}/frameworkDeployments/{framework_deployment_id}`.

        An opaque identifier for the current version of the resource.

        If you provide this value, then it must match the existing value. If the
        values don't match, then the request fails with an
        [`ABORTED`][google.rpc.Code.ABORTED] error.

        If you omit this value, then the resource is deleted regardless of its
        current `etag` value.
