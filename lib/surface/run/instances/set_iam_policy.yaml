    brief: Set the IAM policy for a instance.
    description: |
      This command replaces the existing IAM policy for a instance, given a instance
      and a file encoded in JSON or YAML that contains the IAM policy. If the
      given policy file specifies an "etag" value, then the replacement will
      succeed only if the policy already in place matches that etag. (An etag
      obtain via `get-iam-policy` will prevent the replacement if the policy
      for the instance has been subsequently updated.) A policy file that does not
      contain an etag value will replace any existing policy for the instance.
    examples: |
      The following command will read an IAM policy defined in a JSON file
      'policy.json' and set it for a instance with identifier
      'my-instance'

        $ {command} --region=us-central1 my-instance policy.json

      See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for details of the
      policy file format and contents.
