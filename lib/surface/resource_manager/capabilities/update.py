  """Update a folder capability.

  Command to Update/Set the `value` field of the Folder capability. This
  can be done by using the `--enable` flag to set the value to True, and
  the `--no-enable` flag to set the value to False.

  This command can fail for the following reasons:
      * There is no folder parenting the given capability name.
      * The active account does not have permission to update the given
        folder/capability.

  ## EXAMPLES

  The following command updates a capability with the ID
  `folders/123/capabilities/app-management` to have
  the value True:

    $ {command} "folders/123/capabilities/app-management" --enable

  In order to set the value to False, the following command can be used:

    $ {command} "folders/123/capabilities/app-management" --no-enable
