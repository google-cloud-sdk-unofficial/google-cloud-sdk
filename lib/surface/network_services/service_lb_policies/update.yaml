    help_text: |
      If specified, an unhealthy MIG/NEG will be removed from Global load balancing and traffic
      routing for the service.
      A MIG/NEG is considered to be unhealthy if less than 25% of the instance/endpoints in the
      MIG/NEG are healthy.
      autoCapacityDrain will never drain more than 50% of the configured MIGs/NEGs of a Backend
      Service.
