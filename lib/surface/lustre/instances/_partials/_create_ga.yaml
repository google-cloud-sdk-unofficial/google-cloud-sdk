    description: Create an instance
    examples: |-
      To create the instance, run:

      $ {command}
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        Identifier.
        The name of the instance.
      is_positional: true

    - arg_name: filesystem
      api_field: instance.filesystem
      required: true
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-

      required: true
      repeated: false
      type: long
      help_text: |-
        The storage capacity of the instance in gibibytes (GiB). Allowed values
        are from 18000 to 954000, in increments of 9000.
    - arg_name: network
      api_field: instance.network

      help_text: |-
        The full name of the VPC network to which the instance is connected.
        Must be in the format
        `projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network_name}`.
    - arg_name: description
      api_field: instance.description
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        A user-readable description of the instance.

      repeated: true

    - arg_name: gke-support-enabled
      api_field: instance.gkeSupportEnabled
      action: store_true
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        Indicates whether you want to enable support for GKE clients. By default,
        GKE clients are not supported.
      default: null
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
        request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
