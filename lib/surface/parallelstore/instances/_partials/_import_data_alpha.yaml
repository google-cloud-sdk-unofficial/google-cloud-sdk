    brief: Imports data from Cloud Storage to Parallelstore instance.
    description: |
      Imports data from Cloud Storage to Parallelstore instance.
    examples: |-
      To import data from `gs://my-bucket` storage to `my-instance` run:

      $ {command} my-instance --location=us-central-a --source-gcs-bucket-uri=gs://my_bucket --destination-parallelstore-path='/'
  arguments:
    params:
    - arg_name: source-gcs-bucket-uri
      api_field: importDataRequest.sourceGcsBucket.uri
      required: true
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        URI to a Cloud Storage bucket in the format:
        `gs://<bucket_name>/<path_inside_bucket>`. The path inside the bucket is
        optional.
    - arg_name: destination-parallelstore-path
      api_field: importDataRequest.destinationParallelstore.path
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        Root directory path to the Paralellstore filesystem, starting with `/`.
        Defaults to `/` if unset.
    - help_text: |-
        Name of the resource.
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.parallelstore.v1alpha_resources:project_location_instance
      required: true
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: importDataRequest.requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t
        he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
    - arg_name: service-account
      help_text: |-
        User-specified service account credentials to be used when

        * `{EMAIL_ADDRESS_OR_UNIQUE_ID}`
        * `projects/{PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS_OR_UNIQUE_ID}`
        * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS_OR_UNIQUE_ID}`

        If unspecified, the Parallelstore service agent is used:
