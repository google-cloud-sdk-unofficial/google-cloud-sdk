    brief: |
      Add more cluster endpoints.
    description: |
      This is required to enable multi-vpc for Redis cluster.

      To add one cluster endpoint to an existing Redis cluster, two PSC connections MUST be added as a pair: one for the Redis cluster's discovery service attachment and the other for the additional service attachment.

      Multiple cluster endpoints COULD be added simultaneously.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The cluster specified does not exist.
        * The number of connections provided to a cluster endpoint are not in pairs.
        * One of the connections is not found.
    examples: |
      To connect redis cluster to one additional VPC, run:

        $ {command} my-redis-cluster add-cluster-endpoints --cluster-endpoint='["psc-connection":[{"psc-connection-id":"$ID","address":"$IP","network":"projects/$PROJECT/global/networks/$NETWORK","forwarding-rule":"projects/$PROJECT/regions/us-east1/forwardingRules/$FR_NAME","service-attachment":"projects/$PROJECT/regions/$REGION/serviceAttachments/$SA_NAME"},{$ADDITIONAL_PSC_CONNECTION}]]' --cluster_endpoint=$ADDITIONAL_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT
        $PSCConnectionID SHOULD be extracted from forwarding rules. E.g. 75311697652483351
