  brief: |
    Create a SSE gateway.
  description: |
    Create a new gateway within an existing SSE realm.
  examples: |
    The following command creates a new gateway named `my-gateway` in the location `us-central1` within the SSE realm `my-realm`.

      $ {command} my-gateway --location=us-central1 --realm=my-realm --untrusted-network=my-untrusted-network

    The gateway connects `my-untrusted-network` to a SSE-owned subnet in `us-central1`.
