  brief: |
    Create a SSE gateway.
  description: |
    Create a new gateway within an existing SSE realm.
  examples: |
    The following command creates a new gateway named `my-gateway` in the location `us-central1` within the SSE realm `my-realm`.

      $ {command} my-gateway --location=us-central1 --realm=my-realm --app-vpc=my-app-vpc --user-vpc=my-user-vpc

    The gateway connects `my-app-vpc` and `my-user-vpc` to SSE-owned subnets in `us-central1`.
