        An existing Google Cloud Storage bucket that you want to use instead of
        creating a new bucket during ADC setup.
        If not provided, a default bucket is created during setup.
        The bucket must exist in the same project as the space.
        If the bucket name does not exist in the same project as the space, the
        request fails with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
        If you do not have access to the bucket, the request fails with a
        PERMISSION_DENIED error.
        Format: {$bucket_name}
        For example, if the Cloud Storage bucket URI is gs:\/\/{$bucket_name}, the
        format is {$bucket_name}.
