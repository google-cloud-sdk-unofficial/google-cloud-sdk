        The user-specified Google Cloud Storage bucket for the space.
        This bucket will be used while setting up ADC.
        If not provided, a default bucket will be created.
        Format: {$bucket_name} , name of an already existing cloud storage bucket.
        In case Cloud Storage bucket URI is
        gs://{$bucket_name}, user needs to provide only
        bucket name that is {$bucket_name}. User can only
        provide name of buckets that exist in Cloud Storage. In case user provides
        a bucket name that does not exist, the request will fail with an
        INVALID_ARGUMENT error. In case user does not have access to the provided
        bucket's metadata then the request will fail with a PERMISSION_DENIED
        error. In case user provides a bucket that is not in the same project as
        the Space, then the request will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
