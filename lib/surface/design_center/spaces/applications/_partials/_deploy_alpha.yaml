    brief: Deploy an application
    description: Deploy an application in a space.
    examples: |-
      To deploy the application `my-application` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1`, run:

      $ {command} my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1

      Or run:

      $ {command} projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/spaces/my-space/applications/my-application

      To deploy the application `my-application` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1` and replace the existing deployment, run:

      $ {command} my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1 --replace

      To deploy the application `my-application` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1` using a worker pool `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/workerPools/my-worker-pool`, run:

      $ {command} my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1 --worker-pool=projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/workerPools/my-worker-pool

      To deploy the application `my-application` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1` asynchronously, run:

      $ {command} my-application --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1 --async
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The application name.
        Format:
        projects/$project/locations/$location/spaces/$space/applications/$application

        Flag to update the existing deployment. If not set or false, deploy will
        fail if application `state` is in the `DEPLOYED` state.
      default: null
    - arg_name: worker-pool
      api_field: deployApplicationRequest.workerPool
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        The user-specified Worker Pool resource in which the Cloud Build job will
        execute.
        Format projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{workerPoolId}
        If this field is unspecified, the default Cloud Build worker pool will be
        used. If omitted and application resource ref provided has worker_pool
        defined, that worker pool is used.
    - arg_name: service-account
      api_field: deployApplicationRequest.serviceAccount
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        The email address of the service account to use for this deployment.

        - If provided, this service account will be used to execute the deployment
          process, taking precedence over any service_account specified on the
          Application resource itself for this operation.
        - The caller MUST have the 'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' permission on this
          service account.
        - If this field is omitted, the system will use the 'service_account'
          defined within the Application resource.
        - It is strongly RECOMMENDED to provide a service account either here or on
          the Application resource, as deployment will fail if no service account
          can be determined.
