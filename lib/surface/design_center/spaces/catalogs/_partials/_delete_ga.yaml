    brief: Delete a catalog
    description: Delete a catalog in a space.
    examples: |-
      To delete the catalog `my-catalog` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1`, run:

        $ {command} my-catalog --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1

      Or run:

        $ {command} projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/spaces/my-space/catalogs/my-catalog

      If your catalog contains child resources such as catalog templates, shares, force delete the catalog. To force delete the catalog `my-catalog` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1`, run:

        $ {command} my-catalog --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1 --force

      To delete the catalog `my-catalog` in space `my-space`, project `my-project` and location `us-central1` asynchronously, run:

        $ {command} my-catalog --space=my-space --project=my-project --location=us-central1 --async

    params:
