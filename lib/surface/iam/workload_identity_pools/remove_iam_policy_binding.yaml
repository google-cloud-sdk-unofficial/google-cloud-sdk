  description: |
    Removes a policy binding from the IAM policy of a workload identity pool. A binding consists of at
    least one member, a role, and an optional condition.

  examples: |
    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer` for the user `test-user@gmail.com`
    on a workload identity pool with identifier `my-workload-identity-pool`, run:

      $ {command} my-workload-identity-pool --location="global" --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer'

    To remove an IAM policy binding for the role of `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer` from all
    authenticated users on workload identity pool with identifier `my-workload-identity-pool`, run:

      $ {command} my-workload-identity-pool --location="global" --member='allAuthenticatedUsers' --role='roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer'

    To remove an IAM policy binding which expires at the end of the year 2024 for the role of
    `roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer` and the user `test-user@gmail.com` on a workload identity pool with identifier `my-workload-identity-pool`, run:

      $ {command} my-workload-identity-pool --location="global" --member='user:test-user@gmail.com' --role='roles/iam.workloadIdentityPoolViewer' --condition='expression=request.time < timestamp("2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"),title=expires_end_of_2024,description=Expires at midnight on 2024-12-31'
