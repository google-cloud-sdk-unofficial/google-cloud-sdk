          required: false

          help_text: |-
            A list of access policy rules.
          clearable: true
          spec:
          - api_field: description
            one_of_index: 0
            help_text: |-
              Customer specified description of the rule. Must be less than or equal to
              256 characters.
          - api_field: effect
            one_of_index: 1
            help_text: |-
              The effect of the rule (deny)
          - api_field: principals
            help_text: |-
              The identities for which this rule's effect governs using one or more
               permissions on Google Cloud resources. This field can contain the
               following values:

               * `principal://goog/subject/{email_id}`: A specific Google Account.
                 Includes Gmail, Cloud Identity, and Google Workspace user accounts. For
                 example, `principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com`.


               If an identifier that was previously set on a policy is soft deleted, then
               calls to read that policy will return the identifier with a deleted
               prefix. Users cannot set identifiers with this syntax.
               * `deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}`: A specific
                 Google Account that was deleted recently. For example,
                 `deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
                 the Google Account is recovered, this identifier reverts to the standard
                 identifier for a Google Account.

               * `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}?uid={uid}`: A Google group
                 that was deleted recently. For example,
                 `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com?uid=1234567890`.
                 If the Google group is restored, this identifier reverts to the standard
                 identifier for a Google group.

               * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}`:
                 A Google Cloud service account that was deleted recently. For example,
                 `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-account@iam.gserviceaccount.com?uid=1234567890`.
                 If the service account is undeleted, this identifier reverts to the
                 standard identifier for a service account.
          - api_field: excludedPrincipals
            help_text: |-
              The identities that are excluded from the access policy rule, even if they
              are listed in the `principals`. For example, you could add a Google
              group to the `principals`, then exclude specific users who belong to
              that group.
          - api_field: permissions
            help_text: |-
              The permissions that are explicitly affected by this rule. Each permission
              uses the format `{service_fqdn}/{resource}.{verb}`, where `{service_fqdn}`
              is the fully qualified domain name for the service.
              Currently supported permissions are:

              * `eventarc.googleapis.com/messageBuses.publish`.
          - api_field: excludedPermissions
            help_text: |-
              Specifies the permissions that this rule excludes from the set of affected
              permissions given by `permissions`. If a permission appears in
              `permissions` _and_ in `excluded_permissions` then it will _not_ be
              subject to the policy effect.

              The excluded permissions can be specified using the same syntax as
              `permissions`.
          - api_field: activationConditions
            help_text: |-
              The conditions that determine whether this rule applies to a request.
              Conditions are identified by their key, which is the FQDN of the service
              that they are relevant to, e.g.:

              "activationConditions": {
                "iam.googleapis.com": {
                 "cel_condition": <cel expression>
                }
              }

              Each rule is evaluated independently. If this rule does not apply
              to a request, other rules might still apply.
              Currently supported keys are:

              * `eventarc.googleapis.com`
            spec:
            - api_field: key
            - api_field: value
              spec:
              - api_field: celCondition
                help_text: |-
                  The CEL condition that will be evaluated to determine rule applicability.
                  Note that the attributes and functions that can be used in the condition
                  will be limited by the namespace it is associated with in the
                  `activation_conditions` map.
                  Expr.expression must be less than 512 characters in length.
                spec:
                - api_field: expression
                  help_text: |-
                    Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language
                    syntax.
                - api_field: title
                  help_text: |-
                    Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
                    its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the
                    expression.
                - api_field: description
                  help_text: |-
                    Description of the expression. This is a longer text which
                    describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
                - api_field: location
                  help_text: |-
                    String indicating the location of the expression for error
                    reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
    - arg_name: validate-only
      api_field: validateOnly
      action: store_true_false
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If set, validate the request and preview the update, but do not actually
        post it.
