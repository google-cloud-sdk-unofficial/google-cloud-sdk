  The gcloud iam command group lets you manage Google Cloud Identity &

  Cloud IAM authorizes who can take action on specific resources, giving you
  full control and visibility to manage cloud resources centrally. For
  established enterprises with complex organizational structures, hundreds of
  workgroups and potentially many more projects, Cloud IAM provides a unified
  view into security policy across your entire organization, with built-in
  auditing to ease compliance processes.
