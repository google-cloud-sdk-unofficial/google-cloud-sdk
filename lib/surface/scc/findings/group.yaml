        $ {command} 123456 --group-by="category"

      Group findings under project example-project across all sources by their category:

        $ {command} projects/example-project --group-by="category"

      Group findings under folders 456 across all sources by their category:

        $ {command} folders/456 --group-by="category"

      Group findings under organization 123456 and source 5678, by their category:

        $ {command} 123456 --source=5678 --group-by="category"

      Group ACTIVE findings under organization 123456 and source 5678, by their category:

        $ {command} 123456 --source=5678 --group-by="category" --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\""

      Group ACTIVE findings under organization 123456 and source 5678, on 2019-01-01T01:00:00 GMT, by their category:

        $ {command} 123456 --source=5678 --group-by="category" --filter="state=\"ACTIVE\"" --read-time="2019-01-01T01:00:00Z"

      Group findings under organization 123456 and source 5678 into following 3 state_changes (ADDED/CHANGED/UNCHANGED) based on the activity during past 24 hours:

        $ {command} 123456 --source=5678 --group-by="state_change" --compare-duration=86400s

      help_text: |
        Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The expression is a list of
        one or more restrictions combined via logical operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Parentheses are
        supported, and 'OR' has higher precedence than 'AND'. Restrictions have the form
        '<field> <operator> <value>' and may have a '-' character in front of them to indicate
        negation. Examples include: name, source_properties.a_property, security_marks.marks.marka.
        The supported operators are:
        *  '=' for all value types.
        *  '>', '<', '>=', '<=' for integer values.
        *  ':', meaning substring matching, for strings.

        The supported value types are:string literals in quotes, integer literals without quotes,
        boolean literals 'true' and 'false' without quotes.
        Some example filters: 'source_properties.size = 100', 'category=\"XSS\" AND event_time > 10'
        etc.

      help_text: |
        Expression that defines what findings fields to use for grouping (including 'state').
        String value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list  of fields.

        * resource_name
        * category
        * state
        * parent
