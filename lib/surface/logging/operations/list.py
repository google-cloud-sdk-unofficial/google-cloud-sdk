        Return a list of long running operations in the given LOCATION. The
        operations were scheduled by other gcloud commands.

        For example, a CopyLogEntries operation may be scheduled by the command:
        `gcloud logging copy BUCKET_ID DESTINATION --location=LOCATION`.

        The `--operation-filter` flag is required and must specify the
        `request_type`. Supported request types include but are not limited to:
        `CopyLogEntries`, `CreateBucket` and `UpdateBucket`.

        Additional supported filter expressions include: `operation_start_time`,
        `operation_finish_time` and `operation_state`. These can be combined
        with the case-sensitive keyword `AND` between them.

        For `operation_start_time` and `operation_end_time`, the operators >=,
        >, <=, and < are supported.

        Timestamps must be in either RFC3339 or ISO8601 formats. If the
        timestamp contains a time value, then it must be quoted. For examples:
        "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ", "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ", "YY-MM-DD",
        "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-0000", "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM+0000", "YYYY-MM-DD",
        YYYY-MM-DD, YY-MM-DD, etc.

        The `operation_state` filter expression can be used to filter for
        operations that are in a specific state. The value can be one of the
        following: `SCHEDULED`, `WAITING_FOR_PRECONDITIONS`, `RUNNING`,
        `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `CANCELLED`, `PENDING`.

        For `operation_state`, the operators = and != are supported.

        Other filter options are not supported.
