    brief: Delete a multicloudDataTransferConfig
    description: Delete a multicloudDataTransferConfig
    examples: |-
      To delete the multicloudDataTransferConfig, run:

      $ {command} config-1 \
        --location=europe-west1
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The name of the `MulticloudDataTransferConfig` resource to delete.
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.network_connectivity.v1_resources:projects_locations_multicloud_data_transfer_configs
      required: true
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server can ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server waits
        for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
        the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, can ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate `MulticloudDataTransferConfig`
        resources.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID
        (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) isn't supported.
    - arg_name: etag
      api_field: etag
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        The etag is computed by the server, and might be sent with update and
        delete requests so that the client has an up-to-date value before
        proceeding.
