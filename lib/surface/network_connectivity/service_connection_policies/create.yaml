    brief: Create a new Service Connection Policy.
    description: Create a new Service Connection Policy with the given name.
    examples: |
      Create a Service Connection Policy with name ``my-service-conn-policy''
      for network ``projects/my-project/global/networks/net1''
      and service class ``my-service-class-ad32fa4b'' in region ``us-central1''
      using subnet projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/subnet1
      subject to custom-resource-hierarchy-levels that allows
      connections from Google-managed producer instances in projects/my-project.

        $ {command} my-service-conn-policy --network="projects/my-project/global/networks/net1" --service-class=my-service-class-ad32fa4b --region=us-central1 --subnets=projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/subnet1 --psc-connection-limit=100 --producer-instance-location=custom-resource-hierarchy-levels --allowed-google-producers-resource-hierarchy-level=projects/my-project
