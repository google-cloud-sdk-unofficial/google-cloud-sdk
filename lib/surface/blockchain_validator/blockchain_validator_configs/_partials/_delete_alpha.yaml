    brief: Delete a single blockchain validator configuration
    description: |
      Delete a single blockchain validator configuration from a blockchain node.
    examples: |-
      To delete a blockchain validator configuration `my-validator` in
      the project `my-project` and location `us-central1` run:

      $ {command} my-validator --location=us-central1 --project=my-project
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        Name of the resource
      is_positional: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.blockchain_validator.v1_resources:project_location_blockchain_validator_config
      required: true
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
        request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
