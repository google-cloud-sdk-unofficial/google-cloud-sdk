    brief: Delete an ExadataInfrastructure.
    description: Delete an ExadataInfrastructure.
    examples: |-
      To delete a ExadataInfrastructure with id `my-instance` in the location `us-east4`, run:

      $ {command} my-instance --location=us-east4
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The name of the Cloud Exadata Infrastructure in the following format:
        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cloudExadataInfrastructures/{cloud_exadata_infrastructure}.
      is_positional: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.oracle_database.v1alpha_resources:project_location_cloud_exadata_infrastructure

      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional ID to identify the request. This value is used to identify
        duplicate requests. If you make a request with the same request ID
        and the original request is still in progress or completed, the server
        ignores the second request. This prevents clients from
        accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

      help_text: |-
        If set to true, all VM clusters for this Exadata Infrastructure will be
        deleted. An Exadata Infrastructure can only be deleted once all its VM
        clusters have been deleted.
