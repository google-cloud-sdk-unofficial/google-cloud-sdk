        An optional ID to identify the request. This value is used to identify
        duplicate requests. If you make a request with the same request ID
        and the original request is still in progress or completed, the server
        ignores the second request. This prevents clients from
        accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
