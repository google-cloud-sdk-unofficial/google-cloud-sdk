    brief: Delete a CloudVmCluster.
    description: Delete a CloudVmCluster.
    examples: |-
      To delete a CloudVmCluster with id `my-instance` in the location `us-east4`, run:

      $ {command} my-instance --location=us-east4
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The name of the Cloud VM Cluster in the following format:
        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cloudVmClusters/{cloud_vm_cluster}.
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.oracle_database.v1_resources:projects_locations_cloud_vm_clusters
      required: true
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional ID to identify the request. This value is used to identify
        duplicate requests. If you make a request with the same request ID
        and the original request is still in progress or completed, the server
        ignores the second request. This prevents clients from
        accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
    - arg_name: force

      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If set to true, all child resources for the VM Cluster will be deleted.
        A VM Cluster can only be deleted once all its child resources have been
        deleted.
