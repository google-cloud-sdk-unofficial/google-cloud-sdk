    examples: |
      The following command updates a health aggregation policy:

        $ {command} <HEALTH_AGGREGATION_POLICY_NAME> \
          --region=<REGION> \
          --healthy-percent-threshold 60 \

            Can only be set if the policyType field is
            BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY. Specifies the threshold (as a
            percentage) of healthy endpoints required in order to consider the
            aggregated health result HEALTHY. Defaults to 60. Must be in
            range [0, 100]. Not applicable if the policyType field is
            DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY. Can be mutated. This field is optional,
            and will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this
            threshold and minHealthyThreshold must be satisfied in order
            for HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to network
            endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within an Instance
            Group.

            Can only be set if the policyType field is
            BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY. Specifies the minimum number of
            healthy endpoints required in order to consider the aggregated health
            result HEALTHY. Defaults to 1. Must be positive. Not
            applicable if the policyType field is DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY. Can be mutated. This field is
            optional, and will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this
            threshold and healthyPercentThreshold must be satisfied in
            order for HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to
            network endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within an
            Instance Group.
