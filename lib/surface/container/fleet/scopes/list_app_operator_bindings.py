  """List app operator principals corresponding to a fleet scope and their roles based on project-level IAM bindings, fleet scope-level IAM bindings, and fleet scope RBAC role bindings.

  This command lists bindings corresponding to a fleet scope. The bindings,
  which consist of an app operator principal and a role, grant permissions
  required for an app operator, including usage of fleet scopes, connect
  gateway, logging, and metrics. The overarching principal role
  (view/edit/admin, or custom) is determined by (1) the fleet scope RBAC role
  (view, edit, or admin), (2) the fleet scope-level IAM role
  (roles/gkehub.scopeViewer, roles/gkehub.scopeEditor, or
  roles/gkehub.scopeAdmin), (3) the project-level IAM role
  (roles/gkehub.scopeViewerProjectLevel, or
  roles/gkehub.scopeEditorProjectLevel), and (4) the conditional log view access
  role for the scope bucket.

  This command can fail for the following reasons:
  * The scope specified does not exist.
  * The user does not have access to the specified scope.

  ## EXAMPLES

  The following command lists app operator principals corresponding to `SCOPE`
  under `PROJECT_ID`, their roles, and role details (fleet scope RBAC role,
  fleet scope-level IAM role, project-level IAM role, and log view access):

    $ {command} --scope=SCOPE --project=PROJECT_ID
