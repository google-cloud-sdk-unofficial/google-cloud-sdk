  """Fetch credentials for a fleet-registered cluster to be used in Connect Gateway.

  {command} updates the `kubeconfig` file with the appropriate credentials and
  endpoint information to send `kubectl` commands to a fleet-registered and
  -connected cluster through the Connect Gateway service.

  It takes a project, passed through by set defaults or flags. By default,
  credentials are written to `$HOME/.kube/config`. You can provide an alternate
  path by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. If `KUBECONFIG`
  contains multiple paths, the first one is used.

  Upon success, this command will switch the current context to the target
  cluster if other contexts are already present in the `kubeconfig` file.

  ## EXAMPLES

    Get the Gateway kubeconfig for a globally registered cluster:

      $ {command} my-cluster
      $ {command} my-cluster --location=global

    Get the Gateway kubeconfig for a cluster registered in us-central1:

      $ {command} my-cluster --location=us-central1
