    brief: Searches for Dataplex entries.
    description: Searches for entries matching given query and scope.
    examples: |-
      To search project 'my-project' for Dataplex resources that match the simple predicate 'foo':

        $ {command} 'foo' --project=my-project

  generic:
    # This removes `filter`, `sort-by`, `limit`, and `page-size` flags. `limit` and `page-size` are
    # re-added later in this config. This seems to be the only way to remove flags `filter` and
    # `sort-by` that duplicate functionality of flags that API already has and are exposed with other commands.
