      Identifies the acl for deletion.

      The structure of the acl ID defines the Resource Pattern for which the
      acl entries apply in the Kafka cluster. The acl ID must be structured
      like one of the following:

        For acls on the cluster:
          cluster

        For acls on a single resource within the cluster:
          topic/{resource_name}
          consumerGroup/{resource_name}
          transactionalId/{resource_name}

        For acls on all resources that match a prefix:
          topicPrefixed/{resource_name}
          consumerGroupPrefixed/{resource_name}
          transactionalIdPrefixed/{resource_name}

        For acls on all resources of a given type (i.e. the wildcard literal "*"):
          allTopics (represents topic/*)
          allConsumerGroups (represents consumerGroup/*)
          allTransactionalIds (represents transactionalId/*)
