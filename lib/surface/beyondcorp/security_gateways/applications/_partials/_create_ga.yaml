      help_text: |-
        An array of conditions to match the application's network endpoint.
        Each element in the array is an EndpointMatcher object, which defines a
        specific combination of a hostname pattern and one or more ports. The
        application is considered matched if at least one of the EndpointMatcher
        conditions in this array is met (the conditions are combined using OR
        logic). Each EndpointMatcher must contain a hostname pattern, such as
        "example.com", and one or more port numbers specified as a string, such as
        "443".

        Hostname and port number examples:
        "*.example.com", "443"
        "example.com" and "22"
        "example.com" and "22,33"
