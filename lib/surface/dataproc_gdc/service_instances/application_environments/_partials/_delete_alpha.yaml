    brief: Delete dataproc gdc application environment controller.
    description: |
      Delete dataproc gdc application environment controller.
    examples: |-
      Deletes application environment controller.

      $ {command} my-environment --location=my-location --project=my-project --instance=my-instance
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        The name of the application to delete.
      is_positional: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.dataproc_gdc.v1alpha1_resources:project_location_service_instance_application_environment
      required: true
    - arg_name: allow-missing
      api_field: allowMissing
      action: store_true
      required: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If set to true, and the application is not found, the request will succeed
        but no action will be taken on the server
    - arg_name: etag
      api_field: etag
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        The etag of the application. If this is provided, it must match
        the server etag.
    - arg_name: request-id
      api_field: requestId
      required: false
      repeated: false
      help_text: |-
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
        request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
        ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
        was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
        clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
