    brief: Create a code repository index instance.
    description: |
      Create a code repository index instance.

      The instance will be created in the specified project and location.
    examples: |-
      To create a code repository index instance `my-instance` in project `my-project` and
      location `us-central1`, run:

      $ {command} my-instance --project=my-project --location=us-central1

      To create a code repository index instance `my-instance` in project `my-project`,
      location `us-central1` with your managed encryption key run:

      $ {command} my-instance --project=my-project --location=us-central1
        --kms-key=projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*

      Note: --kms-key can be only passed during index creation and can not be used during update.

        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
