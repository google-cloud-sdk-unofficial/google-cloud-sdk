    brief: Delete a code repository index instance.
    description: Delete a code repository index instance.
    examples: |-
      To delete code repository index instance `my-instance` in project `my-project` and location
      `us-central1`, run:

      $ {command} my-instance --project=my-project --location=us-central1
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-

      help_text: |-
        An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
        so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore
        the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee
        that for at least 60 minutes after the first request.

        The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
        not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

        If set to true, any RepositoryGroups from this CodeRepositoryIndex will
        also be deleted. (Otherwise, the request will only work if the
        CodeRepositoryIndex has no RepositoryGroups.)
