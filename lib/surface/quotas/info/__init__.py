  """Manage Cloud Quotas QuotaInfo.

  QuotaInfo is a read-only resource that provides metadata and quota value
  information about a particular quota for a given project, folder or
  organization. The QuotaInfo resource contains:

  * Metadata such as name and dimension.
  * Quota values for different quota dimensions.

  Cloud Quotas obtains information from the quotas defined by Google Cloud
  services and any fulfilled quota adjustments that you initiate.

  Note: Because QuotaInfo is constructed by incorporating information from
  different sources, a default quota configuration exists even if you have not
  created a QuotaPreference resource. Until you express a preferred state
  through quotaPreference.create or quotaPreference.update, QuotaInfo relies on
  the default quota information available to determine what quota value to
  enforce.
