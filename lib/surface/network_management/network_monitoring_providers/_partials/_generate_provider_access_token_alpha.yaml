    brief: Generate a provider access token.
    description: |-
      Exchanges a valid Google Cloud access token for a temporary access token that can be used to authenticate requests to the partner's platform API.

      The generated partner's access token's lifetime is tied to the input Google Cloud access token; it will expire when the Google Cloud token expires. This token is necessary for any direct API interactions with partner's resources.

      Note: The only supported location for these resources is `global`.
    examples: |-
      To generate a provider access token for the Network Monitoring Provider `my-provider-id`, run:

        $ {command} my-provider-id --location=global --gcp-access-token=<GCP_ACCESS_TOKEN>
  arguments:
    params:
