    brief: Create a VPN connection between an Edge Container cluster and a VPC network.
    description: |
      Creates a new VPN connection.
    examples: |
      To create a connection called 'my-vpn-connection' between the VPC network 'my-vpc' and
      the Edge Container cluster 'my-cluster' which is at region us-central1, run:

        $ {command} my-vpn-connection --location=us-central1 --vpc-network='my-vpc' --cluster='my-cluster'

      Here VPC network and cluster should be under the same project.
