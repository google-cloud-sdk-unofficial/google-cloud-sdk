      brief: Update a existing cloud access binding under an organization.
      description: |
        Update an existing cloud access binding. You can update the level, dry run level or both.
        They can't be both empty after update.
      examples: |
        To update an existing cloud access binding, run:

          $ {command} --binding=my-binding-id --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-abc

        To remove level and add dry run level, run:

          $ {command} --binding=my-binding-id --level=  \
            --dry-run-level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-def

    params:
    - api_field: gcpUserAccessBinding.accessLevels
      arg_name: level
      type: str
      help_text: |
        The access level that replaces the existing level for the given binding. The input must
        be the full identifier of an access level, such as
        `accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-abc`.
    - api_field: gcpUserAccessBinding.dryRunAccessLevels
      arg_name: dry-run-level
      type: str
      help_text: |
        The dry run access level that replaces the existing dry run level for the given binding.
        The input must be the full identifier of an access level, such as
        `accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/new-def`.
    - api_field: gcpUserAccessBinding.reauthSettings.sessionLength
      hidden: true
      arg_name: session-length
      type: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.accesscontextmanager.cloud_bindings:ProcessSessionLength
      release_tracks: [ALPHA]
      help_text: |
        The maximum lifetime of a user session provided as an  ISO 8601 duration string. Must be at
        least one hour or zero, and no more than twenty-four hours. Granularity is limited to
        seconds.

        When --session-length=0 then users in the group attached to this binding will have infinite
        session length, effectively disabling reauth.

        A session begins once a user signs-in successfully. If a user signs out before the end of
        the session lifetime, a new login creates a new session with a fresh lifetime. When a
        session expires, the user is asked to reauthenticate in accordance with reauth-method.

        Setting --reauth-method when --session-length is empty raises an error.

      help_text: |
        Specifies the security check a user must undergo once their session expires. Defaults to
        --reauth-method=LOGIN if unspecified and --session-length is set. Cannot be used when
        --session-length is empty or 0.

        help_text: |
          The user will prompted to perform regular login. Users who are enrolled for two-step
          verification and haven't chosen to "Remember this computer" will be prompted for their
          second factor.
      - arg_value: security-key
        enum_value: SECURITY_KEY
        help_text: |
         The user will be prompted to autheticate using their security key. If no security key has
         been configured, then we will fallback to LOGIN.
      - arg_value: password
        enum_value: PASSWORD
        help_text: |
          The user will be prompted for their password.
    - arg_name: policy
      type: str
