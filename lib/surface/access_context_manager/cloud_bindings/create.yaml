    brief: Create cloud access bindings for a specific group.
    GA:
      description: |
        Create a new cloud access binding. The access level will be bound with the group. The access
        level will be enforced when any user in the group tries to access the Google cloud console
        or API.
      examples: |
        To create a new cloud access binding, run:

          $ {command} --group-key=my-group-key --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc

        To create a new cloud access binding for the dry run access level, run:

          $ {command} --group-key=my-group-key --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc \
            --dry-run-level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/def
    ALPHA:
      description: |
        Create a new access binding. The access level will be bound with the group and the
        restricted client application. The access level is enforced at the organization level for
        all context-aware access group members, as specified in the binding.
        If a restricted client application is specified, then the enforcement applies only to the
        specified application, and not to the entire organization.
      examples: |
        To create a new cloud access binding at the organization level, run:

          $ {command} --group-key=my-group-key --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc

        To create a new cloud access binding for particular applications, run:

          $ {command} --group-key=my-group-key --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc \
            --organization='1234567890' \
            --restricted-client-application-names='Google Cloud SDK, Cloud Console' \
            --restricted-client-application-client-ids='123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com'

        To create a new cloud access binding for the dry run access level at the organization level,
        run:

          $ {command} --group-key=my-group-key --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc \
            --dry-run-level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/def

        To create a new cloud access binding for the dry run access level for particular
        applications, run:

          $ {command} --group-key=my-group-key --level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/abc \
            --dry-run-level=accessPolicies/123/accessLevels/def \

      help_text: |
        The maximum lifetime of a user session provided as an  ISO 8601 duration string. Must be at
        least one hour or zero, and no more than twenty-four hours. Granularity is limited to
        seconds.

        When --session-length=0 then users in the group attached to this binding will have infinite
        session length, effectively disabling reauth.

        A session begins once a user signs-in successfully. If a user signs out before the end of
        the session lifetime, a new login creates a new session with a fresh lifetime. When a
        session expires, the user is asked to reauthenticate in accordance with reauth-method.

        Setting --reauth-method when --session-length is empty raises an error.
