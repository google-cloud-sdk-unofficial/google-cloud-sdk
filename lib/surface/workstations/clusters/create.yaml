      Create a workstation cluster.
    description: |
      Create a workstation cluster.
    examples: |
      To create a public cluster `my-cluster` in region `us-central1`, run:

        $ {command} my-cluster --region=us-central1

      To create a private cluster 'my-private-cluster' associated with network 'my-network' and
      subnetwork 'my-subnetwork'. run:

        $ {command} my-private-cluster --region=us-central1 --enable-private-endpoint
          --network='my-network' --subnetwork='my-subnetwork'

  arguments:
    resource:
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.workstations.resources:cluster
      help_text: |
        Arguments and flags that specify the cluster to create.
    params:
    - arg_name: network
      api_field: workstationCluster.network
      help_text: |
        The network that instances created under the cluster will be associated with.
    - arg_name: subnetwork
      api_field: workstationCluster.subnetwork
      help_text: |
        The subnetwork that instances created under the cluster will be associated with.
    - arg_name: labels
      api_field: workstationCluster.labels
      type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgDict:"
      help_text: |
        Labels that are applied to the cluster and propagated to the underlying Compute Engine
        resources.
    - arg_name: enable-private-endpoint
      api_field: workstationCluster.privateClusterConfig.enablePrivateEndpoint
      type: bool
      default: false
      help_text: |
        Default is false.
        If specified, the cluster will be assigned an internal IP address to the Cluster Gateway.
        This isolates the cluster's workstations from public networks, but requires additional
        configuration. Learn more: https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs.
